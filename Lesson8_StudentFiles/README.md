### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Reading through the Seminole connection pdf, I learned about what an ajax is and how its used to create better quality applications.)
2. (The JSON defintion was insightful because of it being an extension of Javascript, which we have gone through over the past couple of lessons.)
3. (Another lesson that was helpful was learning what was an API key. I found it interesting that it is used for authentification, which is good for legality issues.)
